# This file uses effective state precedence:
# 1. Explicit item settings (true/false) override everything
# 2. Items not listed inherit from enabled collections
# 3. Otherwise items are disabled
#
# To use:
# - Enable collections for curated sets of related items
# - Explicitly set individual items to true/false to override collections
# - Items not mentioned will follow collection settings
#
# After configuring, run: awesome-copilot apply
#
