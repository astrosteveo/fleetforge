## Theoretical Foundations

### Spatial Algorithms

#### Quadtree Partitioning

FleetForge uses quadtree-inspired recursive spatial subdivision:

```
Root World
├── NW Cell ────┐
├── NE Cell     │ Level 1
├── SW Cell     │
└── SE Cell ────┘
    ├── NW Subcell ──┐
    ├── NE Subcell   │ Level 2
    ├── SW Subcell   │
    └── SE Subcell ──┘
```

**Properties:**
- Hierarchical organization
- Balanced load distribution  
- Efficient neighbor finding
- Scalable to large worlds

#### Load Balancing Metrics

Cell splitting decisions based on:

- **Population density**: Number of entities per unit area
- **Computational load**: CPU usage and processing time
- **Network traffic**: Inter-cell communication volume
- **Resource utilization**: Memory, bandwidth, and storage

### Performance Models

#### Scaling Laws

Expected performance characteristics:

- **Linear cell scaling**: O(n) cells support O(n) total entities
- **Logarithmic lookup**: O(log n) time to find entity locations
- **Constant migration**: O(1) time for entity movement within cells
- **Bounded communication**: Limited by AOI radius, not world size

#### Capacity Planning

Resource estimation formulas:

```
Total CPU = Base + (CellCount × CellOverhead) + (EntityCount × EntityCost)
Total Memory = Metadata + (CellCount × CellMemory) + (EntityCount × EntityMemory)
Network BW = ControlPlane + (CellCount × InterCellBW) + (EntityCount × ClientBW)
```
