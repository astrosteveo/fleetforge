## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Security Architecture

#### Container Security

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Source Code] --> B[Security Scanning]
    B --> C[Container Build]
    C --> D[Image Scanning]
    D --> E{Vulnerabilities?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Block Deployment]
    E -->|No| G[Sign & Push]
    G --> H[Deployment]
    
    I[Runtime Security]
    H --> I
    I --> J[Pod Security Standards]
    I --> K[Network Policies]
    I --> L[RBAC Enforcement]
```

**Implementation Details**:

- **Base Images**: Use distroless or minimal base images
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Reduce attack surface by excluding build tools
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate Trivy or Grype in CI/CD
- **Image Signing**: Use cosign for container image signing
- **Runtime Security**: Implement OPA Gatekeeper policies

#### Network Security

```yaml
# Example Network Policy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: fleetforge-controller-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fleetforge-controller
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: monitoring
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080  # Metrics
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: kube-system
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443   # Kubernetes API
```

### Observability Infrastructure

#### Monitoring Stack Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[FleetForge Components] --> B[Metrics Exporters]
    B --> C[Prometheus]
    C --> D[Grafana]
    C --> E[AlertManager]
    E --> F[PagerDuty/Slack]
    
    A --> G[Structured Logs]
    G --> H[Loki]
    H --> D
    
    A --> I[Distributed Tracing]
    I --> J[Jaeger]
    J --> D
```

**Key Components**:

1. **Prometheus Stack**
   - Prometheus Server with HA configuration
   - AlertManager with routing and silencing
   - Node Exporter for infrastructure metrics
   - Blackbox Exporter for endpoint monitoring

2. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Loki for log aggregation
   - Promtail for log collection
   - Structured JSON logging in all components

3. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Jaeger for request tracing
   - OpenTelemetry instrumentation
   - Trace correlation with logs

#### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

| SLI | Target | Alert Threshold | Measurement |
|-----|--------|----------------|-------------|
| WorldSpec Reconciliation Success Rate | >99.9% | <99.5% | Successful reconciliations / Total attempts |
| Reconciliation Latency | <5s (95th %ile) | >10s (95th %ile) | Time from WorldSpec change to reconciliation |
| Cell Creation Time | <30s (95th %ile) | >60s (95th %ile) | Time from reconciliation to cell ready |
| Controller Availability | >99.9% | <99.5% | Controller uptime / Total time |
| API Request Success Rate | >99.95% | <99.9% | 2xx responses / Total requests |

### Reliability Engineering

#### High Availability Design

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Load Balancer] --> B[Controller Instance 1]
    A --> C[Controller Instance 2]
    A --> D[Controller Instance 3]
    
    B --> E[Leader Election]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    
    E --> F[Active Controller]
    G[Standby Controllers] --> E
    
    F --> H[Kubernetes API]
    F --> I[Cell Management]
    
    J[etcd Cluster] --> H
    K[Persistent Storage] --> I
```

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **Leader Election**: Use Kubernetes lease-based leader election
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy 3+ controller replicas across zones
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement proper signal handling and cleanup
- **Circuit Breakers**: Add circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies

#### Backup and Recovery

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Backup Scheduler
    participant E as etcd
    participant V as Velero
    participant O as Object Storage
    
    S->>E: Snapshot etcd
    E->>O: Store etcd backup
    S->>V: Trigger cluster backup
    V->>O: Store resource manifests
    
    Note over S,O: Recovery Process
    O->>E: Restore etcd snapshot
    O->>V: Restore resources
    V->>K8s: Apply manifests
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Resource Management

```yaml
# Controller Resource Configuration
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
    
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: fleetforge-controller
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

#### Caching Strategy

- **Controller Cache**: Optimize informer cache for frequently accessed resources
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff for reconciliation retries
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations to reduce API server load

### Operational Procedures

    F --> G[E2E Tests]
    G --> H[Production Deploy]
    H --> I[Health Checks]
    I --> J[Rollback on Failure]
```

#### Incident Response
